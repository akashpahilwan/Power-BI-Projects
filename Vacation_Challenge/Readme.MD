The Maven's Vacation Challenge!

We have a new dataset provided by Maven Analytics for this #mavenvacationchallenge and here are some of my Key-insights:



There are a total of 280k Property Listing and 5 million Customer Reviews in 10 Cities.

The Average Price per day is inversely proportional to Customer visits, but an exceptional case is Paris here due to its popularity.

Despite having a high Avg Price of 137$ per day, Paris is the City with the maximum Customer visits with a count of 1.21M reviews, followed by Rome with a count of 1.11M reviews but having the least Avg price of 26$ only per day.

The highest average price per day is in the city of Sydney, followed by Cape Town and New york.

55.3% of Total Hosts provides a response rate of within an hour.

50%-80% of all the Customers prefer Entire place while booking, for those if the host response rate is within the hour, there is very very less chance of booking rejection.

New property listing gradually slowed down since 2016 and during the 2020 pandemic, it clustered down completely.

Maximum of customers booked the hotels in the month of April-July(as it is a vacation period)

For the budget of Price per day less than 50$, maximum Customers visits Rome, followed by Mexico City, and Rio de Janerio

For the budget of price per day of more than 50$, maximum Customers prefer to visit Paris, followed by New York and Sydney.

For the budget of less than 50$ per day, 66% of total Customers booked an Entire Place, followed by a Private Room.

For the budget of more than 50$ per day, more than 74% of total Customers booked an Entire Place, followed by a Private Room.

A Total of 50%-80% of Total Customers prefer to book an Entire Place, and 30%-45% of Total customers prefer to book a private room, there is very least percentage of people who book a Shared room or Hotel room.

For the Cities of New York, Rio de Janeiro, and Hong Kong, it's preferable to book a Private Room rather than a Shared room as the Shared room is more Costlier than a Private room.

For the Cities of Bangkok and Rome, it's preferable to book an Entire Place rather than a private room as it is more valuable for almost the same cost.
